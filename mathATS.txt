The math behind an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score involves several components and algorithms that assess how well a resume or cover letter matches a job description. Here is a breakdown of the factors and processes involved:
Key Components of ATS Scoring
Keyword Matching:
Presence and Frequency: The ATS scans the resume for specific keywords and phrases that match those in the job description. The presence and frequency of these keywords significantly impact the score.
Relevance: Keywords must be contextually relevant to the job description, not just present in the document.
Job Match Rate:
This rate measures how closely your resume aligns with the job description. It is calculated based on the relevance of keywords, skills, qualifications, and experience listed in your resume compared to what is required by the job.
Quantifiable Metrics:
Including quantifiable achievements (e.g., "increased sales by 30%") can enhance your ATS score by demonstrating measurable impact.
Formatting and Readability:
Proper formatting ensures that the ATS can parse the resume correctly. Resumes with complex formatting, such as tables or graphics, can result in parsing errors, reducing the score.
Consistency and Accuracy:
Consistent formatting and accurate information (e.g., correct dates, no spelling errors) are crucial for maintaining a high score.
